          There are several ways to foster the mental health wellness of victims
          and survivors of violence, including children, youths, and women, in
          the community. Some of these ways include creating an emotional safety
          plan, exploring survivors’ strengths, creating self-care programs,
          looking for professional mental health support, and learning more
          about setting personal boundaries. Seeking trauma-informed support can
          also help, such as family partnership and mental health resources.{" "}

        <p>Members of society encounter a variety of forms of violence. Due to the prevalence of gender-based violence around the world, this section will mostly address it. Gender-based violence is one of the most egregious forms of human abuse in many civilizations and is intimately related to gender inequality. Violence against a person that is motivated by their gender is referred to as gender-based violence. Gender-based violence affects both men and women, however the majority of victims are women and girls. Because gender-based violence is a global pandemic that affects one in three women in her lifetime, this section concentrates on it. </p>
