          There are several ways to foster the mental health wellness of victims
          and survivors of violence, including children, youths, and women, in
          the community. Some of these ways include creating an emotional safety
          plan, exploring survivorsâ€™ strengths, creating self-care programs,
          looking for professional mental health support, and learning more
          about setting personal boundaries. Seeking trauma-informed support can
          also help, such as family partnership and mental health resources.{" "}
